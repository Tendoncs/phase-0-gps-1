Answer these questions in your reflection:

What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
None really. But some stuff is still a little fussy. It will just take time to learn it 100%.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
There was a cool trick Eddie did. Clicking on the Branch on GitHub would assign it for the compare.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
None really.

What still confuses you about git?
Not much. Just unclear on how the flow works with the system. I know how to use it but I want to know deeper how it works.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Great. Eddie was a great guy and John was amazing as well.
