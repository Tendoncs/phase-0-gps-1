What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I wouldn't say struggling but I was still a little unfamiliar with some commands while using merge and markdown stuff.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
How to use markdown to show an image was clarified by John. Alex also helped by clarifiying how merging works as well as some specifics for branching.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked if when you merge a branch does it still exist afterwards. I also asked some questions about branches.

What still confuses you about git?
Nothing really, I just need to keep working and practicing syntak and all the commands to really get the hang of it.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was great. Both John and Alex were really helpful and understanding.
